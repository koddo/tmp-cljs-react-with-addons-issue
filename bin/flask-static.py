## yes, we have `python3 -m http.server 8000`
## but it dropped connections when I had something like hundred js dependencies in index.html (i'm not insane, that's cljs transpiling)
## major inconvenience
## flask does drop them too, but rarely, quite negligible now for dev env
## next step would probably be to use nginx, but not now
